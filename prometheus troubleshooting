Check the volume is attached or not 

Kubectl get pvc -n prometheus 

Pick the VOLUME id from the above and paste in aws volume console 
Check the instance where this volume is attached 
Navigate to that instance ans ssh 
#sudo su
#df -h

Check the volume attached with which server 

# df -h 
Navigate to aws console search the volume 
Current : 7 gb 
Modify : 16 gb 

Navigate to that server again 
And resize the filesystem
